// Step 1: Get references to the HTML elements we'll be interacting with
// - You need to select the button (for generating the password) and the input field (to display the password).

// Step 2: Create a function to generate a random password
// - You will define all the possible characters you want to include in your password.
//   These will likely include:
//   - lowercase letters
//   - uppercase letters
//   - numbers
//   - special characters like !@#$%^&*()

// Step 3: Set the desired password length
// - Decide how many characters you want the password to be (for example, 12 characters).

// Step 4: Initialize an empty password string
// - You'll use this string to build your random password as you select characters randomly.

// Step 5: Loop through and randomly select characters to form the password
// - Use a loop to add the desired number of characters to the password.
// - To pick a random character:
//     - Generate a random index based on the length of the combined string of characters.
//     - Add the character at that random index to the password string.


// Step 6: Display the generated password
// - Once the password is generated, you need to update the input field to display the password.

// Step 7: Add an event listener to the button
// - The button should trigger the password generation function when clicked.
// - Use an event listener to call your password generation function when the button is pressed.

// Optional:
// - You can add more features like:
//     - A way to choose the password length dynamically (e.g., using a slider or input box).
//     - A way to include/exclude certain character sets (e.g., only letters, or excluding special characters).
//     - A copy-to-clipboard button for ease of use.
